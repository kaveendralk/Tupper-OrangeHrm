# Web UI Automation Suite

-> Project description goes here

## Getting Started

### Mac:
1. Install Java: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
2. Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
3. Install Git: `brew install git`
4. Install Maven: `brew install maven`

## Running the tests

### Modifying environment configuration

For local testing, you can add your config to [serenity.properties](serenity.properties)

When you need this config to apply to Jenkins and Docker:(To be done for feature implemenation)

Specific environment configuration is stored in *./serenity-configs/*
```
serenity-configs/
├── browserstack_webdriver.conf -future if required
├── environment_urls.conf
└── general_settings.conf
```
When adding a new environment, simply add the URL to the list in environment_urls.

general_settings will be applied to **all** config files. Add common serenity parameters in here.

When you want to test the serenity.properties that Jenkins will use:

### Maven command line to run the tests
Whether you are in your laptop or a container, to run all the testcases run the following command:

```
mvn clean verify serenity:aggregate
```

The reports will be generated in `target/site/serenity`

Run the tests like this for running the smoke test suite only 

```
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @FOBSMOKETESTSUITE"
```

### Run tests manually (or using Eclipse) with browser launced

The code is run using:
Go to Pom.xml right click and select Maven build and type the following

```
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @FOBSMOKETESTSUITE"
```

### Run tests manually (or using Eclipse) with headless chrome browser
webdriver.driver = chrome
webdriver.chrome.driver = ./drivers/chromedriver
chrome.switches=--window-size=1920,1080;--headless;

Ask vignesh nehru(nvignesh1234 - git member) if you have questions regarding how to set this setup in Eclipse.

## Continuous integration (Jenkins)

ToDo

### Scheduling planned target for jenkins 

1. `--tags @FOBSMOKETESTSUITE`
2.`--tags @BROKERWORKFLOW1`
3.`--tags @DOTSLIP`
4.`--tags @TRANSPORTSMOKETABNAVIGATIONS`
5.`--tags @TRANSPORTTRIPCOSTCOMPLIANCE'`

Note:
If on Jenkins FOBSMOKETESTSUITE and BROKERWORKFLOW1 should not be executed at same time as both of them use set of values related to 'VigneshCompany'. 
They can be executed one after another
